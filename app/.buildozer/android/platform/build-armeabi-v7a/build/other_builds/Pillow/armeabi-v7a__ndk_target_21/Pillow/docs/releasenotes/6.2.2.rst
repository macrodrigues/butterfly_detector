Security
========

This release addresses several security problems {CVEs TBD), as well as addressing
CVE-2019-19911.

CVE-2019-19911 is regarding FPX images. If an image reports that it has a large number
of bands, a large amount of resources will be used when trying to process the
image. This is fixed by limiting the number of bands to those usable by Pillow.

Buffer overruns were found when processing an SGI, PCX or FLI image. Checks
have been added to prevent this.

Overflow checks have been added when calculating the size of a memory block to
be reallocated in the processing of a TIFF image.
